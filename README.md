# GeeksforGeeks Clone Page

This project is a simple static clone of the GeeksforGeeks homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the basic layout and visual structure without any JavaScript or backend logic.

The page includes a header with a logo, navigation menu, and search bar, followed by a welcome section and featured content cards for different learning areas such as Data Structures, Algorithms, and Web Development. A footer is included for completeness.

This project is designed to strengthen core front-end skills like layout design, spacing, typography, and responsive structure using pure HTML and CSS. It is ideal for beginners who want hands-on practice building clean and professional-looking web pages.
