# GeeksforGeeks Clone Page

This project is a simple static clone of the GeeksforGeeks homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the basic layout and visual structure without any JavaScript or backend logic.

The page includes a header with a logo, navigation menu, and search bar, followed by a welcome section and featured content cards for different learning areas such as Data Structures, Algorithms, and Web Development. A footer is included for completeness.
